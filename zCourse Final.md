You’ve accomplished something amazing! You went from the basics of AI at the Edge, built your skills with pre-trained models, the Model Optimizer, Inference Engine and more with the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ Toolkit, and even learned more about deploying an app at the edge. Best of luck on the project, and I look forward to seeing what you build next!
